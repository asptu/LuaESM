![Alt Text](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/882413954184380527/1014459502399078430/example.gif)

Assyst (made with twilight-rs) vs LuaESM (made with Discordia and lit-vips)

*This is just a general comparison as there are a lot of uncontrolled variables*

## Bugs

- Weird random next line empty space 
- Lacks emoji colour
- Sometimes makes caption text slightly transparent???
